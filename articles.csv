typically only lasts for a few minutes with a total solar eclipse the moon during this weeks event will spend just over an hour in earths shadow but thats not the start of the show like all eclipses there are different phases to monitor during a lunar eclipse as it takes the moon about six hours to slowly make its way through earths shadow and emerge on the other side first the moon will enter earths penumbra or the outer part of its shadow at pm et thursday while the moon may appear to slightly dim it will be incredibly subtle without any difference visible until around am et friday according to sky telescope the partial eclipse during which it looks like a bite has been taken out of one side of the moon will begin at am et as the moon enters earths umbra or its inner shadow according to nasa the lunar planetvac instrument developed by honeybee robotics was deployed to the lunar surface and is shown at the end of blue ghosts surface access arm credit firefly aerospace firefly aerospace related article firefly shares video of blue ghosts nailbiting descent to the lunar surface earths round shadow will shift across the moons face moving from lower left to upper right and the portion of the moon within the umbra will initially appear very dark the entirety of the moon will be within earths umbra beginning at am et for minutes the eclipse peak is expected at am et and totality will end at am et during totality is when the moon will appear coppery orange or red depending on the conditions of earths atmosphere this is when binoculars or a telescope may come in handy as well as longexposure images taken with a camera on a tripod for stability then the eclipse will essentially unfold in reverse the moons red hue will fade as it slowly leaves earths inner shadow receding from upper left to lower right making it look like a bite has been taken out of the other side until am et the moon will then fully exit our planets outer shadow at am et ending the eclipse during the eclipse jupiter and mars will also be visible in the western sky and as earths shadow causes the moons bright glow to dim it might be easier to spot constellations this is what you can expect to see during the entirety of a total lunar eclipse nasas scientific visualization studio the full worm moon total lunar eclipses always occur during the full moon and in this case its during marchs worm moon the moon will be at its fullest at am et on friday morning but it will appear full into saturday morning according to nasa previously it was believed that some indigenous tribes referred to marchs full moon as the worm moon in reference to earthworms that would appear in the soil as warmer temperatures welcomed the spring season but worms may have actually been a reference to beetle larvae emerging from the thawing bark of trees according to the old farmers almanac the first moon of the spring season has a multitude of other monikers across various indigenous groups the flower moon lunar eclipse is seen over nasas michoud assembly facility in new orleans in a composite of seven images that show the partial eclipse and totality captured on may michael demockernasa the creek refer to it as the little spring moon the pueblo peoples name for the moon translates to moon when the leaves break forth and the shawnee call it the sap moon marchs full moon is also considered to be a micromoon which occurs when the moon is at its greatest distance from earth and appears about smaller than a typical full moon according to earthsky the moon will be miles kilometers away from earth on friday versus its average distance of miles kilometers according to nasa more eclipses to follow the partial solar eclipse is seen above the statue of freedom atop the dome of the us capitol building on capitol hill on april in washington dc andrew harnikgetty images eclipses tend to occur in pairs so a solar eclipse typically takes place a couple of weeks before or after a total lunar eclipse according to nasa this time it will be a partial solar eclipse that occurs on march a partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and earth but the celestial bodies arent perfectly aligned according to nasa the moon only blocks part of the suns face during a partial solar eclipse creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a bite out of the sun the partial solar eclipse later this month will be visible across parts of europe asia africa and north and south america a similar pattern will repeat in the fall with a total lunar eclipse shortly followed by a partial solar eclipse the second total lunar eclipse will be visible from europe asia australia africa parts of eastern south america alaska and antarctica on september and the second partial solar eclipse will fall on september and people in parts of australia and antarctica as well as some islands in the pacific ocean will be able to see it check time and

chicago illinois andrew harnikgetty images cnn pete buttigieg announced thursday he will not run for michigans governorship or the states open us senate seat in setting up a potential presidential bid in i care deeply about who michigan will elect as governor and send to the us senate next year but i have decided against competing in either race i remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values and who understand that in this moment leadership means not only opposing todays cruel chaos but also presenting a vision of a better alternative buttigieg said in an x post buttigieg called fellow michigan democrats on thursday morning to tell them of his decision which was first reported by politico a source familiar with buttigiegs thinking said his decision sets him up in the strongest possible position to run for president in the source said running for governor or senate in would have taken that option off the table following the retirement announcement by democratic sen gary peters in late january an adviser to buttigieg told cnn he was taking a serious look at a senate campaign buttigieg said he thought seriously about running for the governorship democratic gov gretchen whitmer who is also seen as a potential contender is termlimited as well as the senate seat after being encouraged by leaders in michigan and having conversations with family friends and officials i considered what i could bring to the race compared to other likely candidates and what running and serving would mean compared to other ways i could make a difference in the years ahead he wrote in a substack post on his decision the former biden transportation secretary described america as less free less secure less democratic and less prosperous under president donald trumps administration and that he will spend time in the coming months engaging both legacy and digital media in the service of a politics of everyday life rooted in the values of freedom security and democracy i will be engaging partners allies friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of american prosperity than either side has so far offered buttigieg wrote the decision has rattled some michigan democrats who are increasingly anxious about holding onto a senate seat in a state president donald trump won last november senate democratic leaders and officials involved with their campaign arm the democratic senatorial campaign committee have been privately lobbying gov gretchen whitmer to run for the seat according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations if whitmer runs top democrats believe she would be their strongest contender to hold the seat for the party but whitmer who is considering a run for president is uninterested according to one of those people other michigan democrats including former sen debbie stabenow are now encouraging freshman rep kristen mcdonald rivet to run behind the scenes according to two people familiar with those discussions the firstterm democrat won a tough battleground seat trump also carried and they believe her midmichigan district which is home to the birthplace of general motors represents the kinds of workingclass voters that their senate candidate would need to win in she would not be the only house democrat to consider a run behind the scenes rep haley stevens is also preparing a possible bid if the party doesnt rally behind another candidate according to the two people familiar buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana mounted a presidential campaign in positioning himself as a moderate he entered race as a relative unknown among nearly twodozen democrats running for the chance to take on trump at the time buttigieg broke barriers as the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president and raised more than million during his run while he had initial success in iowa and new hampshire his campaign struggled to win over voters of color a key base of the democratic party which hurt his performance in nevada and south carolina leading him to end his campaign shortly before super tuesday following his failed bid buttigieg vaulted into cabinet work as transportation secretary under former president joe biden in a move that many democrats saw as needed experience for another presidential run during his tenure

brisbane australia cnn an american tourist who was reportedly filmed picking up and running off with a wild baby wombat may be forced to leave australia if officials reviewing her visa find she has breached its conditions a video shared widely on social media purports to show sam jones who has followers on instagram running with the baby wombat towards a car while its distressed mother chases after her its not clear when the video was shot nor the location but it was at night on what appears to be a country road somewhere in southeastern australia where most wombats reside experts say the animals in the video were common wombats the only one of three species of the australian marsupial which is not threatened or endangered but like all australian native animals they are protected by law australias home affairs minister tony burke said the department was examining joness visa to determine if she had breached any conditions of her stay he suggested she may not ever be welcome back in australia given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again ill be surprised if she even bothers he said in an email statement to cnn i cant wait for australia to see the back of this individual i dont expect she will return australian prime minister anthony albanese waded into the issue late thursday suggesting that jones try her luck with another australian animal that was more likely to put up a fight to take a baby wombat from its mother and clearly causing distress from the mother is just an outrage he said i suggest to this socalled influencer maybe she might try some other australian animals take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there cnn has reached out to jones but has not received a response what the video showed the woman was seen picking up the baby wombat and running away with it to a waiting car samstrayssomewhereinstagram the video reportedly deleted from an instagram account thats since been made private and tiktok on a now deleted account shows a woman running across the road while holding a baby wombat just caught a baby wombat a man laughs offcamera apparently referring to jones look at the mother chasing after her he laughs again referring to the adult wombat which chases the woman onto the road the video has horrified ecologists and wildlife carers who say the sudden separation of the wombat and her baby known as a joey would have triggered stress reactions in both animals yanking a baby away from its mother running away with it and having the baby dangling in hands is sort of pretty high up there in what not to do said professor barry brook an ecologist with the university of tasmania wombats do not typically attack humans but they have incredibly strong claws they use to burrow into the ground if used on human skin they could cause major damage and infection brook said its not a situation you or any other member of the public should put yourself in for both the animals sake and your own sake and broadcasting this on social media to get likes and hits and so forth as an influencer is totally counterproductive he added wildlife veterinarian tanya bishop from the wildlife information rescue and education service wires says the video doesnt show the animals reuniting or if the joey sustained injuries from being carried by its front legs my concern is whether or not that joey had a temporary painful debilitating injury or something that could have been permanent she said bishop said wildlife officials are trying to determine where the video was shot according to australias national broadcaster the abc jones responded to some of the criticism online before turning her social media channels private by saying the baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom northern hairy nosed wombat walking on grass karenfoleyphotographyistockphotogetty images gallery related gallery northern hairynosed wombat back from the brink they wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed she reportedly wrote i dont ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so common wombats the species seen in the video are not considered vulnerable unlike the southern hairynosed wombat which is near threatened and the northern hairynosed wombat which is listed as critically endangered by the iucn red list bishop said while theyre not endangered common wombats are coming under increasing stress from busy roads habitat loss and mange a potentially fatal skin disease all of our wildlife needs as much protection as we can give it said bishop over the years that ive been a wildlife vet ive seen so many species go from being least concerned to being endangered threatened and potentially going to go extinct bishops advice to people who come across australian wildlife stay quiet and enjoy watching them from a distance take video quietly if you want to youre going to see really beautiful interactions and honestly in the case of wombats some of them are pretty funny because baby wombats are very cheeky and naughty ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback subscribe sign in my account
